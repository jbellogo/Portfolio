    <p>
        Judo is about momentum, energy efficient takedowns. 
        When compared to other takedown arts like wrestling, 
        it requires more finess and maybe even skill than athletic ability, 
        strenght and heart.

        How does one obtain this finess? throgh endless repetition. 
        Judo is almost like chess in that the first handfull of moves/sequences should be scripted to suceed. 
        There is just no time to think, some of these matches take seconds at the highest level, 
        so you must go in with a plan designed to test your oponent and respond to his possible reactions.
